# SbomDemoService

Spring Boot 3.3 demo application with the new CycloneDX autoconfiguration
https://spring.io/blog/2024/05/24/sbom-support-in-spring-boot-3-3

## What is SBOM?
Software Bill Of Materials: declares the inventory of software components and dependencies. Analogous to the traditional Bill Of Materials (BOM) in manufacturing that lists all the materials/components/parts used to create an end product.

## Why do we need SBOM?
Keeping track of vulnerabilities and thus of your dependencies is as important as ever.

## How can we get generate an SBOM?
### Spring Boot
https://spring.io/blog/2024/05/24/sbom-support-in-spring-boot-3-3
### NPM
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-sbom
### Others

## What can we do with the generated SBOM?

Dependency-Track: https://docs.dependencytrack.org/.

> *Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in CI/CD environments.*
> - *Tracks component usage across every application in an organizations portfolio*
> - *Quickly identify what is affected, and where*
> - *Identifies multiple forms of risk including*
>  - Components with known vulnerabilities
>  - Out-of-date components
>  - Modified components
>  - License risk
